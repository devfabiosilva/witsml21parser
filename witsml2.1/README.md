# Energistics XSD schemas

This repository contains the Energistics artifacts, and contains XSD schemas and documentation produced by all Energistics work groups. This is the base for all individual ML and combined release packages.

Main branch should represent the output of the schema generation process, based on agreed Enterprise Architect content. Branches can be used to experiment.

The actual content is described in [Package download Readme](./energyml/data/energyML_Download_Package_READ_ME.pdf).
